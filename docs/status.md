## Project Summary
# Since things may have changed since proposal (even if they havenâ€™t), write a shortparagraph summarizing the goals of the project (updated/improved version from the proposal.
Steve will start in a 10x10 grass block platform. There will be at least one tree on this platform for Steve to mine. After all, we've heard that he would like to become a lumberjack. There are several iterative goals for this project. Our first goal is to have Steve find a tree. He may be facing in a direction where there are no trees so Steve will have to turn and find a tree. Our next goal is for Steve to walk towards the tree. You can't mine the tree before you reach it! Finally, we want Steve to mine the tree. Steve will get his input as rgb pixels using ColourMapProducer. We hope to prepare Steve to become a lumberjack worthy of competing with Paul Bunyon.

## Approach
# Give a detailed description of your approach, in a few paragraphs. You should summarize themain algorithm you are using, such as by writing out the update equation (even if it is off-the-shelf). Youshould also give details about the approach as it applies to your scenario.  For example, if you are usingreinforcement learning for a given scenario, describe the setup in some detail, i.e. how many states/actionsyou have, what does the reward function look like. A good guideline is to incorporate sufficient details sothat most of your approach is reproducible by a reader. I encourage you to use figures for this, as appropriate,as we used in the writeups for the assignments. I recommend at least 2-3 paragraphs
We have tried several different approaches to the problem.

## Evaluation
# An important aspect of your project, as we mentioned in the beginning, is evaluating yourproject. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitativeresults. Present the results to convince the reader that you have aworkingimplementation. Use plots, charts,tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at least a 1-2 paragraphs to describe eachtype of evaluation that you perform.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges
# In a few paragraphs, describe your goals for the next 4-5 weeks, whenthe final report is due. At the very least, describe how you consider your prototype to be limited, and whatyou want to add to make it a complete contribution. Note that if you think your algorithm is quite good,but have not performed sufficient evaluation, doing them can also be a reasonable goal. Similarly, you maypropose some baselines (such as a hand-coded policy) that you did not get a chance to implement, butwant to compare against for the final submission. Finally, given your experience so far, describe some of thechallenges you anticipate facing by the time your final report is due, how crippling you think it might be,and what you might do to solve them

## Resources used
# Mention all the resources that you found useful in writing your implementation. This shouldinclude everything like code documentation, AI/ML libraries, source code that you used, StackOverflow, etc.You do not have to be comprehensive, but it is important to report the ones that are crucial to your project. Iwould like to know these so that the more useful ones can be shared with others in the course
